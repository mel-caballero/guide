See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference.Note 3: Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.Note 4: An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.",

The visual presentation includes the component's visible content, border, and component-specific background.

In WCAG 2.1 and 2.0 this Success Criterion should be considered as always satisfied for any content using HTML or XML.Note 2: Since this criterion was written, the HTML Standard has adopted specific requirements governing how user agents must handle incomplete tags, incorrect element nesting, duplicate attributes, and non-unique IDs.Although the HTML Standard treats some of these cases as non-conforming for authors, it is considered to \"allow these features\" for the purposes of this Success Criterion because the specification requires that user agents support handling these cases consistently.
